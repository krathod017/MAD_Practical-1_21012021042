Practical-1: Perform Programs in Kotlin Programming Language.

1.Store & Display values in different variable of different type (Integer, Double, Float, Long, Short, Byte, Char, Boolean, String)

2.Type conversion:
Integer to Double, String to Integer, String to Double.

3.Scan studentâ€™s information and display all the data.

4.Find the number is odd or even by using Control Flow inside println() method.

5.Display month name using When

6. By using a user defined function perform all arithmetic operations.

7.Find the factorial of number by recursion. Explain "tailrec" keyword.

8.Create different types of Array as shown in image. Explore Arrays.deepToString(), contentDeepToString() methods, IntArray variable .joinToString()  and use in program to print Array. Explore range, downTo, until etc. for loop and use in this program. Sort Array of Integer data type without using inbuilt function & with using inbuilt function

9.Find the max number from ArrayList.

10. Write Different types of Class & Constructor. Create a class Car and set various members like type, model, price, owner, milesDrive. add the function getCarPrice in it. Create an object of Car class and access property of it. (getCarInformation(), getOriginalCarPrice(), getCurrentCarPrice(), displayCarInfo() etc.)

11. Write about Operator Overloading. Perform Matrix Addition, Subtraction & Multiplication using Class Matrix & operator overloading. Overload toString() function in Matrix class.

Exercise:
1.Swap Value of two variables without using third variable and with using third variable.

2. Create two class named as Product and Laptop. Inherit with this information: Product class should be parent and child class should be Laptop class. 
Add Product Name, Quantity, Amount per Quantity in Product class. In Laptop class add CPU name, RAM size, HDD Size, etc. of Laptop configuration. 
Create primary and secondary Constructor of both class. 
If Primary constructor is there then can we create secondary constructor in inheritance? 
If we can create secondary and primary constructor both in child class then what is restriction if parent have more than two different secondary constructor? 
Create List of 5 laptops in ArrayList and display all objects information.

3. Create two class named as Person and Student. Inherit with this information: Person class should be parent and child class should be Student class. 
Add first name, last name, age in Person class. In Laptop class add enrollment no, branch, class, lab batch, etc. 
Create primary and secondary Constructor of both class. 
Create List of 5 students in ArrayList and display all objects information
